//
// Blinky Example for (what to name it?) STM8S103 boards
// -------------------------------------------------
// This will assume an LED has been connected to PB5
// The LED will blink at 1 Hz
//
// This is a very basic example, to be used to verify your setup.
// This example does not initialise any clocks and the MCU runs on power on 
// defaults.
